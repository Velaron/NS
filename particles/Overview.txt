Particle system goals
---------------------

Versatility
  Not dependent on Half-life, OpenGL or any particular output device or API

Collision detection with arbitrary areas
  This would be nice but isn't necessarily needed

Arbitrary updating of particle source

Ability to hook into Worldcraft or be dynamically generated
  As an entity

Ability to have multiple particle systems at once, all with different parameters

Allow static and near-static systems
  Volumetric light, haze

Allow custom behavior on collision (less important)
  Including altering particle lifetime, draw mode or creation of new particles inheriting characteristics with some randomly alteration
  Allows rain that spatters on hit, waterfall that mists


Suggests handle/manager based system
Suggests extendable classes for drawing, updating and iterating through systems
Allow creating of templates which can be named and then later created
